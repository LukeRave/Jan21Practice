Please create an application that contains 2 screens:
Screen 1
Please display the results of the API query in a list.
Choose one of the fields from the API result to display in each list entry to uniquely identify that entry.
Upon tapping one of the entries, the application should go to a second screen.

Screen 2
Please show the image linked from the API for this entry.
Please add a favorite button on this screen.
When tapping the favorite button, the second screen closes and returns you to the first screen.
You should also be able to go back from the second screen to the first screen without favoriting the item.
On the first screen, the list item will be shown as favorited.

Extra:
 Screen 2: when tapping favorite button again, remove the heart icon on the first screen for that item (un-favorite feature)
 Save the favorite list so it persists over multiple launches
 Each photo should only be downloaded once and saved in a temporary cache while app is in use (but not persisted over multiple launch)
